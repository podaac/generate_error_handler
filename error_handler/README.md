- EventBridge rule to catch Batch job failures and target Lambda function.
- SNS Topic for Batch job failure with a topic policy and an email subscription.

To deploy:
1. Edit `terraform.tfvars` for environment to deploy to.
2. Edit `terraform_conf/backed-{prefix}.conf` for environment deploy.
3. Initialize terraform: `terraform init -backend-config=terraform_conf/backend-{prefix}.conf`
4. Plan terraform modifications: `terraform plan -out=tfplan`
5. Apply terraform modifications: `terraform apply tfplan`

`{prefix}` is the account or environment name.
